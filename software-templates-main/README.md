# software-templates

This repository is a collection of software and documentation templates for the Backstage community. The templates are organized into two folders: `scaffolder-templates` for Backstage Software Templates and `documentation-templates` for general documentation templates. Contributions are welcome for new and existing templates!

## scaffolder-templates

[Backstage Software Templates](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/) are used to create new software components through Backstage. These templates are intended as a starting point to build on for different use cases. You may also use them as provided, but we recommend pointing your Backstage app to a forked copy because the templates aren't versioned at this time, and as such breaking changes can happen without warning.

## documentation-templates

The documentation templates provide recommended structure and content for different types of documentation, for example system architecture documents or runbooks.
